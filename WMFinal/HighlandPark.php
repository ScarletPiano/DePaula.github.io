Just a leisurely stroll through the flowers, with the distant lilt of music, is sure to take every worry away.<br/><br/>

            With the spring comes the end of a bitter and snowy Rochester winter, and with the first sign of warm weather, comes the first hint of flowers. Often taking place at the start of May, the Lilac Festival is used to celebrate the sun and showers that accompany the end of the grey season. Music, food stalls, live entertainment, all of it bursts through and colors Highland Park with the spring, competing with their flowering counterparts!
