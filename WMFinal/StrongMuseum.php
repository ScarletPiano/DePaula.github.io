            <a href="https://www.museumofplay.org/">The Strong National Museum of Play</a> has its values written right in its name! Aiming to preserve how generations of children have sought entertainment, the Strong Museum does more than just catalogue their finds. Rather than let items collect dust, they encourage visitors to play with each artifact themselves, and are constantly adding to the collection!<br/><br/>
            The Strong Museum aims to delight in entertainment and the beauty of a childlike nature. From digital to mechanical, doll to robot, the Strong Museum has it all! There's even a butterfly exhibit that allows visitors to enter a greenhouse filled with hypnotic petal-winged insects, creating a magical memory to last a lifetime.
