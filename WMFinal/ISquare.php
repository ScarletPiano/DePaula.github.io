            Originally belong to the Senecas, they named the town Irondequoit to mean "Where the land meets the water". Generations later the land has kept that name, and it is spoken with pride, being the only "Irondequoit" in the  country.<br/><br/>
            Irondequoit Square was created in an effort to keep with its roots, and return a semblance of the natural world within the mechanics. Through reproducing every form of renewable energy in its upkeep (save for that of nuclear), I-Square has done all that they set out to do and more, as their work continues growing, and the community along with it.
