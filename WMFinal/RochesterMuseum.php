            The purpose of the <a href="https://rmsc.org/">Rochester Museum and Science Center</a> is to fully delve in and explore the curious nature of mankind. From hands-on activities to thoughtful critiques on futuristic developments, The Rochester Museum and Science Center does well to engage an audience keen on experimentation.<br/><br/>
            Now, if over 1.2 million objects don't seem to be that big of a deal, and the thought of electricity, chemicals, and mechanical know-how doesn't spark a flame, worry not, for there's still more to discover! With an entire planetarium to control at a whim, the Rochester Museum and Science Center even hold light show nights in which the artificial sky lights up with lasers at the sound of Pink Floyd playing in the background.<br/><br/>
            If none of that sounded fun, than maybe the RMSC really isn't for you. But don't worry, there's plenty more to discover on a tour through Rochester!
