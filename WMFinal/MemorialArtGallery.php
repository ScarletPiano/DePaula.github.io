            <a href="http://mag.rochester.edu/">Rochester Memorial Art Gallery</a> (MAG) has more than 5,000 years of art history haunting its walls; despite this incredible feat, the MAG doesn't stop there in terms of interesting features.  With hundreds of creative workshops, social events, it's "clothesline festival" and much more, it doesn't take much to find something to do.

            It's not every day that an organization has an 80th anniversary, and with a goal to fund the arts such as theirs, the Gallery Council is fated for a fine future. This October (2020) will mark their 80th year of running events, and raising funds to maintain the many pieces of history and creation housed within the Memorial Art Gallery.
